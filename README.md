# Code

`The idea behind DFS is to go as deep into the graph as possible, and backtrack once you are at a vertex without any unvisited adjacent vertices.`

`It is very easy to describe / implement the algorithm recursively: We start the search at one vertex. After visiting a vertex, we further perform a DFS for each adjacent vertex that we haven't visited before. This way we visit all vertices that are reachable from the starting vertex.`


```
vector<vector<int>> adj; // graph represented as an adjacency list
int n; // number of vertices
vector<bool> visited;
void dfs(int v) {
    visited[v] = true;
    for (int u : adj[v]) {
        if (!visited[u])
            dfs(u);
    }
}
```
